          <span class="font-medium text-zinc-900"></span>Today for every
          business big or small, having a
          <span class="font-medium">virtual presence</span> is as important as
          having a registered office / shop (premise) in the real world. I see
          only 2 ways every business can do it either via website or having
          social media presence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having a website is like having an shop/ office in some remote corner
          of the city wherein business has to constantly, engage in marketing,
          seo and other activities to attract
          <span class="font-medium"> users/clients. </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          While having a social media presence is like having a leased
          establishment in a mall, wherein there are ample users/clients, but
          the business can never own the space, data, content, community and can
          be silenced, banned, removed, etc. Thus soley relying on the mercy of
          the owners/administrators. What do we plan to build?
